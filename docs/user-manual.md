# Welcome to Quote.Vote

Quote.Vote is a text-first civic engagement platform designed for thoughtful public dialogue. It’s a space where people can post, vote, and discuss written content focusing on ideas instead of algorithms or ads.

### Core Principles

- **Text-First:** Quote.Vote emphasizes words over visuals. Every conversation starts from written ideas, not photos or memes.
- **Public-by-Default:** All posts and discussions are open and visible to everyone. This promotes transparency and shared understanding.
- **Respectful Participation:** Engage with curiosity and empathy. Listen, read carefully, and respond thoughtfully.
- **Reflection Over Reaction:** Take a moment to understand before responding. The platform encourages meaningful dialogue instead of quick takes.

 **Tip:** Quote.Vote is designed for reflection, not argument. The more you engage with respect and clarity, the better the discussions become.


## Voting on Text

Voting lets you express agreement or disagreement with specific parts of a post — not just the post as a whole. This helps surface the most valuable insights and keeps discussions focused on ideas.

### How to Vote

1. Open any post.
2. Hover over or tap on the text you’d like to respond to.
3. Small **upvote (👍)** and **downvote (👎)** icons will appear next to the text.
4. Click **Upvote** to show agreement or appreciation, or **Downvote** to signal disagreement or concern.
5. Your vote is recorded instantly, and you can change it anytime.

### What Your Vote Means

- **Upvote (👍)** → You agree, support, or find the text valuable.  
- **Downvote (👎)** → You disagree, or think it’s inaccurate or unhelpful.  

## Transparency ##

Votes are public by default anyone can see how each passage is rated. This encourages honesty, reflection, and accountability in public dialogue.

** Quoting & Highlighting **

On Quote.Vote, you can pull out powerful lines or thoughts from any post by highlighting text and turning it into a quote.

How to create a quote:

- Select any text you find meaningful or worth discussing.

- A small popup menu will appear - click “Quote”.

- Add an optional attribution or citation URL (e.g., the source of the text).

- If you used an AI tool to assist your post, check the “AI-generated” indicator box for transparency.

- Hit Post Quote — your quote will appear in its own discussion thread (a quote room).

Tips:

- Quoting is public by default others can join your quote’s thread and respond.

- Keep quotes short and focused (one key idea per quote).

- Avoid editing quotes to change meaning — only quote what’s actually written.

Example:

“Reflection is more powerful than reaction.”
— Highlighted from a user post, now open for discussion.
