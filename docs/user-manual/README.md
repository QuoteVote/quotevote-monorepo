## Welcome & Principles

### What is Quote.Vote?

Quote.Vote is a **text-first civic engagement platform** designed for thoughtful public dialogue. Unlike traditional social media, Quote.Vote emphasizes:

- **Text-first content**: Focus on substance over sensationalism
- **Targeted voting**: Vote on specific passages within posts, not just entire posts
- **Public by default**: Transparent discussions that encourage accountability
- **Reflection over reaction**: Thoughtful engagement rather than quick reactions
- **No ads, no algorithms**: Community-driven content discovery

### Core Values

- **Respectful participation**: Engage with ideas, not personal attacks
- **Transparency**: Public moderation notes and clear community guidelines
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-first design with screen reader support
- **Attribution**: Proper citation for quotes and AI-generated content

- **Effect**: Increases visibility of quality content
- **Location**: Vote buttons appear next to each paragraph or text block

#### Downvoting (üëé)

- **Effect**: Helps filter low-quality content
- **Note**: Use sparingly and constructively

### Voting on a Passage

2. Locate the passage you want to vote on
3. Click the **upvote (‚Üë)** or **downvote (‚Üì)** button next to it
