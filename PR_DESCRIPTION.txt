## Description
This PR addresses Issue #266 by updating multiple outdated dependencies in both the client and server applications to fix known security vulnerabilities.

## Changes

### Client (`client/package.json`)
- Updated `axios` to `^1.7.7` (Fixes known vulnerabilities in 0.21.1)
- Updated `lodash` to `^4.17.21` (Fixes prototype pollution)
- Updated `moment` to `^2.30.1` (Latest version)

### Server (`server/package.json`)
- Updated `mongoose` from `^5.9.13` to `^6.12.0` (Major version update for security and features)
- Updated `axios` to `^1.7.7`
- Updated `lodash` to `^4.17.21`
- Removed `request` dependency (Deprecated and unused in codebase)

### Code Changes
- **`server/app/server.js`**: Removed deprecated Mongoose connection options (`useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`, etc.) which are no longer needed/supported in Mongoose 6+.

## Testing
- Verified `npm install` completes successfully in both client and server.
- Server starts successfully with Mongoose 6.
- Client builds successfully.

## Checklist
- [x] Updated `client/package.json`
- [x] Updated `server/package.json`
- [x] Updated `server/app/server.js` for Mongoose 6 compatibility
- [x] Removed unused/deprecated dependencies
